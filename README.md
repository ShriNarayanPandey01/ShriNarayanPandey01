# YorFit E-Commerce Website

## Project Overview
YorFit is a full stack e-commerce website designed to provide customers with a seamless online shopping experience for clothing. The unique feature of this platform is the integration of machine learning techniques, including 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to suggest the best fitting clothing size based on customer video recordings.

## Features
- **Product Listings**: Display of clothing items with details such as images, descriptions, prices, and sizes.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Shopping Cart**: Functionality to add, remove, and update items in the shopping cart.
- **Order Management**: Users can place orders and track their purchase history.
- **Video-Based Size Recommendation**: Customers can record videos to receive personalized clothing size recommendations using 3D CNN and machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: React.js, Vite
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **API Integration**: FastAPI

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YorFit.git
    cd YorFit
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables (e.g., database URI, API keys).

4. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Key Components
- **Front-End**:
  - Developed using React.js and Vite for efficient and fast development.
  - Responsive design ensured with CSS/SCSS and styled-components.
  - State management with React's Context API/Redux.
  - Routing handled by React Router.

- **Back-End**:
  - Server-side application built with Node.js and Express.js.
  - RESTful APIs developed for communication between front-end and back-end.
  - Integration with FastAPI for backend services and machine learning model interactions.

- **Machine Learning**:
  - Implemented 3D CNN using TensorFlow to analyze customer video recordings and suggest the best fitting clothing size.
  - Utilized additional machine learning models for enhanced recommendations.

- **Database**:
  - Managed using MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
  - Firebase used for authentication and secure user data handling.

## Deployment
- The application can be deployed on cloud hosting platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or Vercel for reliable and scalable access.
